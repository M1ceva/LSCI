Sample file(s) acquired with laser speckle illumination. They can be used for initial playing with the LSCI Toolbox.

1) File 1: 01.Aphid_NA=0.1_M=4x_xyz=600x350x100_t=4ms_fps=250_pol=parallel_bd=Y8.tiff

NA = Numerical aperture = 0.1
M = Magnification = 4
xyz = stack size = 600(width) px X 350(height) px X 100(depth/time) frames
t = camera exposure time = 4 ms
fps = camera frames per seconds = 250 fps
pol = polarization of excitation and detection = parallel
bd = image(s) bit depth = 8 bits

2) File 2: 02.RawLaserSpeckle_xyz=260x214x51_t=10ms.tiff
